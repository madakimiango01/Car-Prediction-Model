Most of the cars have naturally in the data set aspirated engines
Most of the cars in the data set have 4 doors
The cars with the highest distribution are of sedan type, while the lowest distribution are convertible.
Most of the cars in the data set are front-wheel drives, while the lowest are four-wheel drives

Cars that use diesel have a higher price than those that use gas
Convertible cars and hardtop cars have the highest prices, while hatchback cars have the lowest price
Cars with rear engines have a higher price than those with front engines
Cars with 4 doors have a higher price than those with 2 doors
Cars with four-wheel drives have higher prices.

Columns such as wheelbase, bore ratio, compression ratio and stroke, have strong correlation with the price
